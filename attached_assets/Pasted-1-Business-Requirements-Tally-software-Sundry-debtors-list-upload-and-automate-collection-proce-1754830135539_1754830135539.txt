1.	Business Requirements:
•	Tally software Sundry debtors list upload and automate collection process and transparency, monitor my staff is working on it without asking to my staff.
•	owner, office staffs, customers
•	The Collection Management Application will operate in a streamlined workflow to manage customer payments efficiently. The process begins when the admin uploads an Excel file (exported from Tally) containing customer names, phone numbers, and outstanding amounts. The system automatically matches each entry with existing records—updating the outstanding amount for existing customers or prompting the admin to confirm details for new ones—before saving the data in the database. The dashboard displays all customers with their contact details, outstanding amounts, follow-up status, and promised payment amounts. Employees have restricted access, allowing them only to update the collection amount, promised payment date, disputes, and notes, ensuring sensitive data remains protected. Customers can be sent one-click WhatsApp/SMS reminders using stored templates. The admin can generate a PDF of received payments from the latest import for updating Tally records, keeping balances accurate for future imports. Access is role-based: only admin-approved users can log in, revoked users have their data deleted, and customers can log in only if their number exists in the system to view payment history or raise disputes. This workflow ensures a continuous cycle of Import → Match → Update → Follow-up → Payment Confirmation → PDF Export → Tally Update, with minimal admin effort and no duplication.
